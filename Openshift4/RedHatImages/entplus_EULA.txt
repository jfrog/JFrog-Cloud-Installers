2. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be construed and governed in accordance with the laws of the State of Israel, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of laws thereof, and the competent courts of Tel-Aviv shall have sole and exclusive jurisdiction over all disputes between the parties, and you further agree and submit to the exercise of personal jurisdiction of such courts for litigating any such claim or action.
