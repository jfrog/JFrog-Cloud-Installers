The Amazon VPC architecture includes public and private subnets. The first set of private
subnets share the default network access control list (ACL) from the Amazon VPC, and a
second, optional set of private subnets includes dedicated custom network ACLs per subnet.

Optionally you may choose to deploy a completely public VPC (no private subnets), or a completely private VPC (no public subnets).

The Quick Start divides the Amazon VPC address space in a predictable manner across
multiple Availability Zones, and deploys NAT gateways for outbound Internet access.

You can use this Quick Start as a building block for your own deployments. You can scale it
up or down by adding or removing subnets and Availability Zones according to your needs,
and add other infrastructure components and software layers to complete your AWS
environment.
