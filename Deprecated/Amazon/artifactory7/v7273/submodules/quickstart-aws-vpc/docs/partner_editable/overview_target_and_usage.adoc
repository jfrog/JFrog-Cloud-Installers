This Quick Start provides a networking foundation for AWS Cloud infrastructures. It
deploys an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) according to AWS best practices
and guidelines. Amazon VPC is the networking layer for Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud
(Amazon EC2) and provides a private, isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can
launch AWS services and other resources in a virtual network. For a discussion of best
design practices for Amazon VPC environments, see the documentation and articles listed
in the link:#_other_useful_information[Other useful information] section.
