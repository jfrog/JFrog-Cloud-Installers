After you use this Quick Start to build your VPC environment, you can deploy additional
Quick Starts or deploy your own applications on top of this AWS infrastructure. If you
decide to extend your AWS environment with https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/[additional Quick Starts] for trial or production
use, we recommend that you choose the option to deploy the Quick Start into an existing
VPC, where that option is available.

If you decide to deploy additional private subnets with dedicated network ACLs, make sure
you review the configuration and adjust it accordingly. By default, the custom ACLs are
configured to allow all inbound and outbound traffic to flow in order to facilitate the
deployment of additional infrastructure. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_ACLs.html[Network ACLs] and
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Appendix_NACLs.html[Recommended Network ACL Rules for Your VPC] in the Amazon VPC documentation.

// Provide post-deployment best practices for using the technology on AWS, including considerations such as migrating data, backups, ensuring high performance, high availability, etc. Link to software documentation for detailed information.

The architecture built by this Quick Start supports AWS best practices for high availability
and security. The Quick Start provides:

* Up to four Availability Zones for high availability and disaster recovery. (AWS
recommends maximizing your use of Availability Zones to isolate a data center outage.)
Availability Zones are geographically distributed within a region and spaced for best
insulation and stability in the event of a natural disaster.

* Separate subnets for unique routing requirements. AWS recommends using public
subnets for external-facing resources and private subnets for internal resources. For
each Availability Zone, this Quick Start provisions one public subnet and one private
subnet by default. (If you need public subnets only, you can disable the creation of the
private subnets.) For subnet sizing strategies, see the next section.

* Additional layer of security. AWS recommends using network ACLs as firewalls to
control inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet level. This Quick Start provides an
option to create a network ACL protected subnet in each Availability Zone. These
network ACLs provide individual controls that you can customize as a second layer of
defense.

We recommend that you use network ACLs sparingly for the following reasons: they can
be complex to manage, they are stateless, every IP address must be explicitly opened in
each (inbound/outbound) direction, and they affect a complete subnet. We recommend
that you use security groups more often than network ACLs, and create and apply these
based on a schema that works for your organization. Some examples are server roles and
application roles. For more information about security groups and network ACLs, see
the link:#_security[Security] section later in this guide.

* Independent route tables configured for every private subnet to control the flow of
traffic within and outside the Amazon VPC. The public subnets share a single routing
table, because they all use the same Internet gateway as the sole route to communicate
with the Internet.

* Highly available NAT gateways deployed, that offer major advantages in terms of deployment,
availability, and maintenance over NAT instances. For more information see the http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/vpc-nat-comparison.html[comparison]
provided in the Amazon VPC documentation.

* Spare capacity for additional subnets, to support your environment as it grows or
changes over time.

=== Subnet Sizing

In this Quick Start, the sizing of CIDR blocks used in the subnets is based on a typical
deployment, where private subnets would have roughly double the number of instances
found in public subnets. However, during deployment, you can use the CIDR block
parameters to resize the CIDR scopes to meet your architectural needs.

In the default subnet allocation, the VPC is divided into subnet types and then further
segmented per Availability Zone, as illustrated in link:#_architecture[Figure 1]. The Quick Start provides the
following default CIDR block sizes to maximize capacity:

[cols="60,40a", options="header",grid=none, frame=topbot, stripes=even]

Alternatively, there may be situations where you would want to separate the CIDR scopes
by dividing the VPC into Availability Zones and then into subnet types. The recommended
CIDR blocks to maximize capacity for this scenario are as follows:

[cols="60,40a", options="header",grid=none, frame=topbot, stripes=even]

To customize the CIDR ranges for this scenario or to implement your own segmentation
strategy, you can configure the Quick Start parameters described in link:#_launch_a_new_vpc[Launch a new VPC]. For more
information about VPC and subnet sizing, see the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Subnets.html#VPC_Sizing[AWS documentation].



== Security
// Provide post-deployment best practices for using the technology on AWS, including considerations such as migrating data, backups, ensuring high performance, high availability, etc. Link to software documentation for detailed information.

=== Public and Private Subnets
This Quick Start provisions one public and one private subnet in each Availability Zone by
default. You can also choose to add additional private subnets with dedicated network
ACLs.

A public subnet is directly routable to the Internet via a route in the route table that points
to the Internet gateway. This type of subnet allows the use of Elastic IPs and public IPs, and
(if the security group and network ACLs permit) a public subnet is reachable from the
Internet. A public subnet is useful as a DMZ infrastructure for web servers and for Internetfacing Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) load balancers.

Private subnets can indirectly route to the Internet via a NAT gateway.
NAT Gateways reside in a public subnet in order to route directly to the Internet.
Instances in a private subnet are not externally reachable from outside the Amazon VPC,
regardless of whether they have a public or Elastic IP address attached. A private subnet is
useful for application servers and databases.

=== Using Security Groups and Network ACLs
The following table describes the differences between security groups and network ACLs:

|===
|Security group  |Network ACL

// Space needed to maintain table headers
|Operates at the instance level (first layer of defense)  |Operates at the subnet level (second layer of defense)
|Supports allow rules only |Supports allow rules and deny rules
|Is stateful: Return traffic is automatically allowed, regardless of any rules|Is stateless: Return traffic must be explicitly allowed by rules
|We evaluate all rules before deciding whether to allow traffic|We process rules in numerical order when deciding whether to allow traffic
|Applies to an instance only if someone specifies the security group when launching the instance, or associates the security group with the instance later on| Automatically applies to all instances in the subnets it's associated with (backup layer of defense, so you don't have to rely on someone specifying the security group)
|===

The network ACLs in this Quick Start are configured as follows:

* All public and private subnets are associated with the same default network ACL, which
is automatically created for all VPCs on AWS. This network ACL allows all inbound and
outbound traffic. As you deploy instances and services, you should associate them with
security groups and allow only the traffic and ports needed for your application.
* Each additional private subnet is associated with a custom network ACL (1:1 ratio).
These network ACLs are initially configured to allow all inbound and outbound traffic to
facilitate the deployment of additional instances and services. As with the other subnets,
you should use security groups to secure the environment internally, and you can lock
down the custom network ACLs during or after deployment as required by your
application.
