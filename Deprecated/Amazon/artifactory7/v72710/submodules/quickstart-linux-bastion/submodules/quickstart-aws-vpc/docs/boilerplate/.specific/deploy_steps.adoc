WARNING: If you’re deploying {partner-product-short-name} into an existing VPC, make sure that your VPC has two private subnets in different Availability Zones for the workload instances, and that the subnets aren’t shared. This Quick Start doesn’t support https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-sharing.html[shared subnets^]. These subnets require https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html[NAT gateways^] in their route tables, to allow the instances to download packages and software without exposing them to the internet.

Also, make sure that the domain name option in the DHCP options is configured as explained in the http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_DHCP_Options.html[Amazon VPC documentation^]. You provide your VPC settings when you launch the Quick Start.

Each deployment takes about {deployment_time} to complete.
